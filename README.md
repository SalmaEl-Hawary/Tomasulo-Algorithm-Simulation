# Tomasulo-Algorithm-Simulation

## 1. Overview
This project implements a Tomasulo algorithm simulator supporting register renaming, reservation stations, reorder buffer (ROB), load/store buffers, common data bus (CDB), and branch speculation. It executes a custom 16-bit instruction set and simulates out-of-order and speculative execution cycle-by-cycle.

The simulator reads instructions from program.txt and memory initialization from memory.txt.
